# Twitter-Free Mornings

This is a Chrome extension to hide your Twitter feed every morning. Hopefully you gain a few minutes back every day.

You can download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-free-mornings/aakcffljphdeofhdfjpbggfolejicbhh) and see the Product Hunt launch [here](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/twitter-free-mornings).

If you like it, feel free to share it with your friends (or enemies).
