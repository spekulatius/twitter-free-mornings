# Twitter-Free Mornings

This is a Chrome extension to hide your Twitter feed every morning. Hopefully you gain a few minutes back every day.

You can download the extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-free-mornings/aakcffljphdeofhdfjpbggfolejicbhh) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-free-mornings/). The Product Hunt launch is [here](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/twitter-free-mornings).

If you like it, feel free to share it with your friends (or enemies).
